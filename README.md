## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CKD_college_project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```env
   # Flask Configuration
   SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   
   # Database Configuration (optional)
   MYSQL_HOST=localhost
   MYSQL_USER=root
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MYSQL_DB=ckd
   
   # Application Configuration
   FLASK_ENV=development
   FLASK_DEBUG=True
   ```
   
   **Note**: Replace `your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production` with a strong secret key, and update the database credentials if you plan to use MySQL for diet recommendations.

5. **Database Setup (Optional)**
   If you want to use diet recommendations:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ckd;
   USE ckd;
   
   CREATE TABLE diet_plan (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       Stage VARCHAR(10),
       dietType VARCHAR(10),
       Breakfast TEXT,
       MorningSnack TEXT,
       Lunch TEXT,
       AfternoonSnack TEXT,
       Dinner TEXT
   );
   ```

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

## üì± Usage

1. **Homepage**: Learn about CKD, kidney care, and causes
2. **Prediction Form**: Fill in your medical test results
3. **Results**: Get AI-powered prediction with detailed analysis
4. **Download Report**: Get a comprehensive PDF report
5. **Diet Recommendations**: View personalized diet plans (if database is configured)

## üìä Model Information

The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model (`ckd.pkl`) that analyzes:
- Blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar
- Red blood cells, pus cells, bacteria presence
- Blood glucose, urea, creatinine, electrolytes
- Hemoglobin, cell counts, medical history
- Age, gender, and other demographic factors

## üè• Medical Disclaimer

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **ModuleNotFoundError**: Make sure all dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Flask-MySQLdb Import Error**: If you see `ImportError: cannot import name '_app_ctx_stack' from 'flask'`, this is a version compatibility issue. The requirements.txt file has been updated with compatible versions. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
   ```

2. **Database Connection Error**: 
   - Check MySQL is running
   - Verify database credentials in `.env` file
   - The app will work without database (diet recommendations won't be available)

3. **Model Loading Error**:
   - Ensure `ckd.pkl` file is in the root directory
   - Check file permissions

4. **Model Compatibility Error**: If you see `'DecisionTreeClassifier' object has no attribute 'monotonic_cst'`, this is a scikit-learn version compatibility issue. The application now includes a fallback prediction system that will work even if the model has compatibility issues.

4. **Port Already in Use**:
   ```bash
   # Change port in app.py or kill existing process
   lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
   ```
